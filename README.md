# My Chef Repository

This repo is my personal repository of [Chef][] cookbooks. As recommended in
the Chef docs, the initial repo was cloned from the Opscode template
[chef-repo][]. I've left the various empty directories (e.g., `certificates`)
intact, in case I need them.

I use this repo is a dumping ground for common cookbooks I use across specific
[Vagrant][] and [Chef][] configurations. Some of the cookbooks are cribbed
from other places on the web; others are mine. The metadata for a cookbook
usually spells out where it came from.

If a cookbook is mine, it's released under a BSD license and copyright
&copy; Brian M. Clapper. See the `LICENSE.md` file in this repository.
Cookbooks I've cribbed from elsewhere have their own licenses, and their
authors retain copyright.

The original [chef-repo][] README is in `Chef-README.md`.
